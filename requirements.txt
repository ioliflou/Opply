### ðŸ“„ Updated `process_buyer_leads.py` (with cleanup and paths)

You should update the top of your script for portability and clarity:

```python3
import json
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path


python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt


# Path to data
DATA_PATH = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1] / "data" / "processed_buyer_leads.json"
